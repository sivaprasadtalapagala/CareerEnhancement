===============What is HTML?(,html)================

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard text formatting language used for developing web pages released in 1993. HTML is a language that is interpreted by the browser and it tells the browser what to display and how to display.

HTML is an important language to learn if anyone wants to work in the web development domain [Web designers, Web Developers]. HTML alone is not sufficient for a web developer because HTML only defines the structure of the data that will be rendered on the browser in a webpage, to make it visually appealing and to make it functional, we will need to use CSS and Javascript respectively. 


The latest version of HTML is HTML5. There are two main components in HTML language, Tags and Attributes. The below image shows some basic HTML tags and attributes.

=========1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?
No. HTML elements are defined by a starting tag, may contain some content and a closing tag.For example, <h1>Heading 1</h1> is a HTML element but just <h1> is a starting tag and </h1> is a closing tag.

=========2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?
Tags are the primary component of the HTML that defines how the content will be structured/ formatted, whereas Attributes are used along with the HTML tags to define the characteristics of the element. For example, <p align=” center”>Interview questions</p>, in this the ‘align’ is the attribute using which we will align the paragraph to show in the center of the view.

========3. What are void elements in HTML?
HTML elements which do not have closing tags or do not need to be closed are Void elements. For Example <br />, <img />, <hr />, etc.

========4. What is the advantage of collapsing white space?
In HTML, a blank sequence of whitespace characters is treated as a single space character, Because the browser collapses multiple spaces into a single space character and this helps a developer to indent lines of text without worrying about multiple spaces and maintain readability and understandability of HTML codes.

========5. What are HTML Entities?
In HTML some characters are reserved like ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘/’, etc. To use these characters in our webpage we need to use the character entities called HTML Entities. Below are a few mapping between the reserved character and its respective entity character to be used.

Character	Entity Name	Entity Number
<	&lt;	&#60;
>	&gt;	&#62;
&	&amp;	&#38;
(non-breaking space) Eg. 10  PM	&nbsp; Eg. <p>10&nbsp&nbspPM</p>	&#160;

=========6. What are different types of lists in HTML?
In HTML, you can create different types of lists to organize and structure your content. The main types of lists are:

Ordered Lists (ol):
Ordered lists are used for items that have a specific sequence or order. Each item in an ordered list is typically numbered (or lettered) by default, and the order of items matters. You create an ordered list using the <ol> tag, and each list item is defined with the <li> (list item) tag. Here's an example:

html
Copy code
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
This will result in a numbered list, like:

1.1.First item
1.2.Second item
1.3.Third item

Unordered Lists (ul):
Unordered lists are used when the order of items doesn't matter, and the items are usually displayed with bullet points. You create an unordered list using the <ul> tag, and each list item is defined with the <li> tag. Here's an example:

html
Copy code
<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
  <li>Oranges</li>
</ul>
This will result in a bulleted list, like:

.Apples
.Bananas
.Oranges

Description Lists (dl):
Description lists are used when you want to provide a term and its description. They consist of terms (defined using the <dt> tag) and their descriptions (defined using the <dd> tag). Here's an example:

html
Copy code
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>
This will result in a list like:

.HTML
  .HyperText Markup Language
.CSS
  .Cascading Style Sheets
These are the main types of lists in HTML, and you can use them to structure your content in various ways based on your specific needs.


===========7. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML?
The class attribute is used to specify the class name for an HTML element. Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value. Also, it is mainly used to associate the styles written in the stylesheet with the HTML elements.

==========8. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements?
Multiple elements in HTML can have the same class value, whereas a value of id attribute of one element cannot be associated with another HTML element.

If you use the same "id" for different elements, it can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when using JavaScript or CSS to select or style those elements. It can also cause validation issues in your HTML document.

==========9. Define multipart form data?
Multipart form data is a way to send information from a web page to a server, especially when you need to upload files, like images or documents. It's like putting data into different envelopes before sending it.

Here's a simple explanation:

Normal Forms: For regular text input (like your name or email), you can use a regular form with the default enctype attribute (which is application/x-www-form-urlencoded). It's like sending a letter with a single sheet of paper.

Multipart Forms: When you need to send files (pictures, videos, etc.), you use "multipart/form-data." It's like sending a package with multiple items in separate boxes. Each piece of data, including files, is put in its own box, and the server knows how to open each box and handle the content inside.

So, you use "multipart/form-data" when you want to upload files through a web form. This way, the server can receive and process those files correctly, like when you upload photos to a social media website or attach files in an email.


===========10. Describe HTML layout structure.
Every web page has different components to display the intended content and a specific UI. But still, there are few things which are templated and are globally accepted way to structure the web page, such as:

<header>: Stores the starting information about the web page.
<footer>: Represents the last section of the page.
<nav>: The navigation menu of the HTML page.
<article>: It is a set of information.
<section>: It is used inside the article block to define the basic structure of a page.
<aside>: Sidebar content of the page.


===========11. How to optimize website assets loading?
To optimize website load time we need to optimize its asset loading and for that:

CDN hosting - A CDN or content delivery network is geographically distributed servers to help reduce latency.
File compression - This is a method that helps to reduce the size of an asset to reduce the data transfer
File concatenation - This reduces the number of HTTP calls
Minify scripts - This reduces the overall file size of js and CSS files
Parallel downloads - Hosting assets in multiple subdomains can help to bypass the download limit of 6 assets per domain of all modern browsers. This can be configured but most general users never modify these settings.
Lazy Loading - Instead of loading all the assets at once, the non-critical assets can be loaded on a need basis.


==========12. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?
 HTML has various formatting tags:

<b> - makes text bold
<i> - makes text italic
<em> - makes text italic but with added semantics importance
<big> - increases the font size of the text by one unit
<small> - decreases the font size of the text by one unit
<sub> - makes the text a subscript
<sup> - makes the text a superscript
<del> - displays as strike out text
<strong> - marks the text as important
<mark> - highlights the text
<ins> - displays as added text



=========13. What are the different kinds of Doctypes available?
DOCTYPE declarations are used in HTML to specify the version of the HTML standard being used for a web page. Each of the doctypes you mentioned has a specific purpose and affects how the web browser interprets and renders the HTML content. 

The three kinds of Doctypes which are available:

Strict Doctype 
Transitional Doctype
Frameset Doctype


==========14. Please explain how to indicate the character set being used by a document in HTML?
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <meta charset="UTF-8">
   ...
   ...
 </head>
 ...
</html>

The <meta> tag with the charset attribute, as shown in your example, is used to specify the character encoding for a web page. It is placed in the <head> section of an HTML document and plays a crucial role in ensuring that text and special characters are displayed correctly in a web browser. Here's a detailed explanation of its use:

Character Encoding:

Character encoding is a method of representing text characters in binary form so that computers can understand and render text properly.
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8) is a widely used character encoding that can represent virtually all characters from all human languages, making it a standard choice for web content.
Specifying Character Encoding:

The <meta> tag with the charset attribute allows you to specify the character encoding used in your web page.
In your example, <meta charset="UTF-8"> specifies that the character encoding for the page is UTF-8. This ensures that the browser interprets and displays the content correctly, especially when it contains non-ASCII characters, such as accented letters, symbols, or characters from languages other than English.
Compatibility:

Specifying the character encoding in this way helps ensure compatibility with various web browsers, as it informs the browser how to interpret and display the text content.
Without a specified character encoding, the browser may use its default encoding, which can lead to rendering issues for special characters.
SEO and Accessibility:

Using the correct character encoding is important for search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility. It ensures that search engines can index and understand the content correctly, and it aids screen readers and assistive technologies in providing accessible content to users with disabilities.
In summary, the <meta charset="UTF-8"> tag is a critical part of HTML documents as it specifies the character encoding used in the page, ensuring that text and special characters are displayed accurately. Using UTF-8 is a best practice for modern web development, as it supports a wide range of characters and languages, making your content accessible and readable to a global audience.


============15. What is the difference between <strong>, <b> tags and <em>, <i> tags?
The effect on a normal webpage of the tags <strong>, <b>  and <em>, <i> is the same. <b> and <i> tags stands for bold and italic. These two tags only apply font styling and bold tag <b>, just adds more ink to the text, these tags don't say anything about the text.

Whereas, <strong> and <em> tags represent that the span of text is of strong importance or more importance and emphatic stress respectively than the rest of the text. These tags have semantic meaning.

============16. What is the significance of <head> and <body> tag in HTML?
<head> tag provides the information about the document. It should always be enclosed in the <html> tag. This tag contains the metadata about the webpage and the tags which are enclosed by head tag like <link>, <meta>, <style>, <script>, etc. are not displayed on the web page. Also, there can be only 1 <head> tag in the entire Html document and will always be before the <body> tag.

<body> tag defines the body of the HTML document. It should always be enclosed in the <html> tag. All the contents which needs to be displayed on the web page like images, text, audio, video, contents, using elements like <p>, <img>, <audio>, <heading>, <video>, <div>, etc. will always be enclosed by the <body> tag. Also, there can be only 1 body element in an HTML document and will always be after the <head> tag.

============17. Can we display a web page inside a web page or Is nesting of webpages possible?
Yes, we can display a web page inside another HTML web page. HTML provides a tag <iframe> using which we can achieve this functionality.

<iframe src=”url of the web page to embed” />
