comments!: string;

The ! is called the definite assignment assertion.

It tells TypeScript:

“Trust me, I will assign a value to this property later, so don’t worry about it being undefined.”

✅ Use case: When a property cannot be initialized immediately in the constructor but will definitely get a value before use.

Example:

export class FeedbackComponent {
  comments!: string;

  ngOnInit() {
    this.comments = "User feedback"; // initialized later
  }
}


No compile-time error, even though it’s not initialized at declaration.

2️⃣ comments: string;

Without !, TypeScript expects that the property will be initialized immediately (either inline or in the constructor).

If not, with strict mode enabled, TypeScript will give an error:

Property 'comments' has no initializer and is not definitely assigned in the constructor.
